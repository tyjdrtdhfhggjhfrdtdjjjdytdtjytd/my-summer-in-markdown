# SUMMER 2024 -- will 😝

## BOWLING

I went bowling over multiple intervals of time with two of my best friends. I definitely beat both of them.

## THRIFTING

I went thrifting a lot both in person and online. I had a lot of fun being able to get clothes that couldn't be found in a mall or a Target, and they were a lot cheaper as well as more fitting to what I wanted. I was able to be more authentic in my style and preferences and could model my wardrobe after how I wanted to present. I went to a Goodwill with a friend and got most of the stuff online from Depop.
