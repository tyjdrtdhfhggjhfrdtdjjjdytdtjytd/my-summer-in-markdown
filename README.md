# SUMMER 2024 -- will üòù

## ACTIVITIES

I went thrifting a lot both in person and online. I had a lot of fun being able to get clothes that couldn't be found in a mall or a Target, and they were a lot cheaper as well as more fitting to what I wanted. I was able to be more authentic in my style and preferences and could model my wardrobe after how I wanted to present. I went to a Goodwill with a friend and got most of the stuff online from Depop.

I also went skating with my dad. I had a great time and it was the first time I'd been out on the ice for a while. One of my skate blades broke, though, so I ended up having to use rentals and they had toe picks. I can't stand the toe picks. I hate them so so so much. I skate relatively low, so to be tripping over them all the time was not entertaining. My dad got a laugh out of it, though.

## PLAYLISTS

Most of the songs I had streaming over the summer were 99% of **Charli XCX**'s brat album, along with the "Girl, so confusing featuring Lorde" song which, as stated, features **Lorde**. 

## SPORTS

I took PE over the summer because I couldn't take it this year and didn't want to do it in junior year. I had a lot of fun, though, as most of my friends took it too. We played a lot of volleyball and badminton. As stated before, I was also able to skate more and play some hockey, which is always great.

## FAVORITE BOOK/MOVIE

I reread Franz Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* over summer, along with a couple by George Orwell and Cheryl Strayed. They are some of my favorite authors without a doubt. I'm more into classic, but Strayed has such a brutal and genuine way with words that certainly does not help me go outside more often. I rewatched *Miracle* (2004) a lot, too. It was fun.

## FOOD

I tried a lot of new foods. I went to a ramen place with my friend and her family and it was great. I also got boba with my boyfriend on numerous occasions, and boba's always pretty good.
